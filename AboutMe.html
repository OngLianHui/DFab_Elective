                  <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am Lian Hui from DEEE Year 3</p>
                    <p>I study Electrical and Electronic Engineering. The diploma consist of electrical and electronics as well as a small portion of learning how to code using C++ and use Fusion360
                        and AutoCAD. I have went through a 6months internship where I was able to work on a similar 3D design software called Solidworks. During those 6 months I have made
                        quite a few different 3D prints such as the company logo and as well as namecard holders, especially with dual extrusion.

                    <p>I like to play games such as FPS games and open world games, watch videos and sometimes draw in my free time.</p>
